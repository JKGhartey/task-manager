# TypeScript Types Fix for Render

## ðŸš¨ Issue Resolved

The TypeScript compilation was failing because type definitions were in `devDependencies`, but Render runs in production mode and doesn't install dev dependencies.

## âœ… Fix Applied

### Moved Type Definitions to Dependencies

```json
// Before (devDependencies)
"@types/bcrypt": "^5.0.2",
"@types/cors": "^2.8.19",
"@types/express": "^5.0.3",
"@types/jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.10",
"@types/node": "^24.0.11",

// After (dependencies)
"@types/bcrypt": "^5.0.2",
"@types/cors": "^2.8.19",
"@types/express": "^5.0.3",
"@types/jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.10",
"@types/node": "^24.0.11",
```

### Why This Works

- **Production builds** only install `dependencies`
- **TypeScript compilation** needs type definitions
- **Moving types to dependencies** ensures they're available during build

## ðŸš€ Expected Build Process Now

```
==> Running build command 'npm install'...
==> Starting TypeScript compilation...
==> TypeScript compilation completed
==> Checking dist folder...
==> dist/server.js
==> Build completed successfully
==> Running 'npm start'
==> Server is running on port 10000
```

## ðŸ“‹ Files Modified

1. **`backend/package.json`** - Moved type definitions to dependencies
2. **Kept development tools** in devDependencies (nodemon, ts-node)

## âœ… Verification

After deployment, test:

```bash
curl https://your-app-name.onrender.com/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{ "status": "OK", "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z" }
```

The TypeScript compilation should now succeed and create the `dist/server.js` file!
