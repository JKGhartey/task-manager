# Build Fix for Render Deployment

## ðŸš¨ Issue: Missing dist/server.js

The deployment is failing because TypeScript compilation isn't creating the `dist/server.js` file.

## âœ… Fixes Applied:

### 1. Updated package.json

- Added `--noEmitOnError` flag to TypeScript compilation
- Added build verification echo

### 2. Created verify-build.sh

- Script to verify TypeScript compilation
- Checks if dist folder and server.js are created
- Provides detailed error messages

### 3. Updated render.yaml

- Uses the verification script in build command
- Ensures proper build process

## ðŸ”„ Build Process Now:

```
1. npm install (install dependencies)
2. chmod +x verify-build.sh (make script executable)
3. ./verify-build.sh (run verification script)
   - Compiles TypeScript
   - Verifies dist/server.js exists
   - Reports success/failure
4. npm start (runs compiled server)
```

## ðŸš€ Expected Output:

```
==> Running build command 'npm install && chmod +x verify-build.sh && ./verify-build.sh'...
==> Starting build verification...
==> Compiling TypeScript...
==> Build completed successfully
==> Build verification successful!
==> dist/server.js exists and is ready to run.
==> Running 'npm start'
==> Server is running on port 10000
```

## ðŸ”§ If Issues Persist:

1. **Check TypeScript errors** in the build logs
2. **Verify all imports** are correct
3. **Ensure tsconfig.json** is properly configured
4. **Check file permissions** on the build script

The verification script will provide detailed error messages if the build fails.
